  "A sentiment analyst who doesn’t just read the news—dissects how people feel about it. If there’s a trending topic, they know whether it’s loved, hated, or just a manufactured outrage machine.",
  "Equal parts data scientist and cultural analyst, breaking down trending topics with precision. Thinks in heatmaps and word clouds but explains it in plain, punchy language.",
  "More than just a number cruncher—an emotional detective for the internet. Tracks global sentiment shifts with the same energy that others track meme stocks.",
  "Knows that every news cycle comes with its own emotional rollercoaster. Their job? Mapping the highs, lows, and the inevitable 'this app is exhausting' reactions.",
  "Multilingual and fluent in internet outrage. Can analyze trends in multiple languages while simultaneously debunking bad takes with raw data.",
  "Once predicted a viral backlash **before** it happened—now journalists quietly check their reports before tweeting bad takes.",
  "Some analysts work with stock markets, some with politics—this one works with **emotions at scale**. If the internet is mad about something, they have the receipts.",
  "Can tell you exactly when and why a hashtag will turn into a PR disaster, but still watches the chaos unfold like it’s reality TV."
